    Objective: Write unit tests for a React or Angular component or service to ensure it functions correctly.
    Requirements: Use Jest with React Testing Library or Jasmine/Karma with Angular to test component rendering, event handling, and integration with services. Mock dependencies where necessary. 

This part is not yet done. I am still learning the unit testing.

Q5. Fetch Data from an API and Display It

    Requirements: Implement error handling for API requests, and display data dynamically in the user interface. Ensure the application updates correctly based on the fetched data.

created the .env file to fetch the api url. Sent that data to a component and displayed it in a tabular format. 

I also applied the pagination logic.
